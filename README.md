# PhylobarData

These data can be use to reproduce the results in the paper,
"[Oral microbial signatures of head and neck cancer patients with diverse longitudinal oral mucositis severity patterns](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.665024v1.full)" which analyzes a data set originally generated in
"[Influence of oral microbiome on longitudinal patterns of oral mucositis severity in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cncr.35001)." Code to
reproduce the examples can be found at the OMScoreAnalysis repository on Github:

zhang2023-ps.rds is a phyloseq object that combines all other microbiome and
sample information in this upload.
